# Steganography

The goal of this project is to write a C #GUI application that is capable of hiding and encrypting images and text-based messages within image files. 

The application must provide the following functionality:

* Load, display, and hide a message(image or text-based)in 24-bit BMP or PNG files only.
* Display both the  source image and the resulting output (destination) image after the message has been hidden within the source image.
* Save the resulting destination image.
* Extract and display the message within the destination image file.
* Allow the ability to encrypt and decrypt the message hidden within the source image.
